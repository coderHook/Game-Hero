# Beginner Bootcamp Homework - Hero Game

### In this repo you can find the first assigment for first week of the bootcamp.

Basically, the test were pretty straight forward and on the first commit I added all of them, and checking that all passes. Section 1, 2 and 3.

After that, I started to deal with this "Extra user stories", Section 4.

#### Section 4 - Show me what you got
 - Write displayStats function that writes your hero's name, health, weapontype, weapon damage to the page. Call it at the end of your script

 - Create a form that allow users to change the name of their hero.

 - Call displayStats when some data of the hero has changed to update the page.

 - Implement fighting an enemy. (how you do it is up to you!)

 - When an enemy or weapon gets clicked it gets deleted from the page.

 The main problem that I encountered is that after implementing some of the features, because of the test pass a couple of times through the same function some tests stop working, I just had to change a litle bit the logic of the game for this.

 Also there is some solution to not displaying some elements on I used inline styling that, with more time, I would like to change it, and style it more user friendly.

 The take away after this challenge is that I got a better understaing of functions and their scope, I competely understand how the DOM is working and how to select items and manipulate them with javascript. I am very proud to see how much I am able to implement now after this past week.
